### ***DESCRIPTION***

***OBJECTIVE***
"War" the card game's prime objective is to win all 52 cards!

***THE DEAL***

The deck is shuffled and then divided evenly between 2 players, with each player receiving 26 cards.

***THE PLAY***

Each player flips a card from their respective decks at the same time. The player with the higher value card takes both flipped cards and puts them face down at the bottom of his deck.
If the cards are of the same value... it is War!

***WAR***

In a "War" scenario each player is to draw 3 cards and place them in a face down pile next to the card that triggered the "War". A final card is drawn by each player flipped face up at the same time and placed next to their face down pile. The player with the higher value final card takes all dealt cards by both players that turn and puts them face down at the bottom of his deck.
If the cards are of the same value it is "War" again!

***HOW TO KEEP SCORE***

The game ends when one player has won all 52 cards.
